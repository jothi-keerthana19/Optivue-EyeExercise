The core problem is that the face detection model (likely MediaPipe, based on your code's comments) might always return a result, but if no face is found, that result will be empty. Your current logic doesn't seem to be checking for this emptiness or for the confidence score of the detection.

Hereâ€™s how you can significantly improve the accuracy.

## 1. The Main Fix: Update Your Backend Logic
The most crucial change is on the server side. You need to modify your SimplifiedEyeTracker to only return True when a face is detected with a reasonably high confidence level.

Since you didn't provide simplified_eye_tracker.py, here is a complete, high-quality implementation you can use. This version uses MediaPipe and includes the necessary confidence check.

Create a new file named simplified_eye_tracker.py and add this code:

Python

import cv2
import mediapipe as mp
import numpy as np

class SimplifiedEyeTracker:
    """A simplified eye tracker using MediaPipe for robust face detection."""
    
    def __init__(self, min_detection_confidence: float = 0.6):
        """
        Initializes the eye tracker with MediaPipe's face detection model.
        
        Args:
            min_detection_confidence (float): The minimum confidence value ([0.0, 1.0])
                                              for a face detection to be considered successful.
        """
        # Initialize MediaPipe Face Detection
        self.mp_face_detection = mp.solutions.face_detection
        self.face_detection = self.mp_face_detection.FaceDetection(
            min_detection_confidence=min_detection_confidence
        )

    def process_frame(self, frame: np.ndarray) -> dict:
        """
        Processes a single frame to detect a face.

        Args:
            frame (np.ndarray): The image frame from the camera (in BGR format).

        Returns:
            dict: A dictionary containing the success status and whether a face was detected.
        """
        if frame is None:
            return {'success': False, 'face_detected': False, 'message': 'Input frame is None'}

        try:
            # For performance, mark the image as not writeable to pass by reference.
            frame.flags.setflags(write=False)
            
            # MediaPipe expects RGB, but OpenCV provides BGR. Convert the frame.
            frame_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
            
            # Process the frame and find faces
            results = self.face_detection.process(frame_rgb)
            
            # Restore writeable flag
            frame.flags.setflags(write=True)

            # --- THIS IS THE CRITICAL CHECK ---
            # 'results.detections' is a list of detected faces.
            # If it's not None and not empty, a face was found above our confidence threshold.
            if results.detections:
                # You can even check how many faces were detected: len(results.detections)
                return {'success': True, 'face_detected': True}
            else:
                # No face was detected that met the confidence threshold.
                return {'success': True, 'face_detected': False}

        except Exception as e:
            return {'success': False, 'face_detected': False, 'message': str(e)}

Why this works:
Confidence Threshold: By setting min_detection_confidence=0.6, we tell MediaPipe to ignore any potential "face" that it isn't at least 60% sure about. This immediately filters out most false positives from random patterns in the background. You can adjust this value between 0.0 and 1.0.

Checking for Detections: The line if results.detections: is the most important part. It directly checks if the list of detected faces is empty. If it's empty, we know for sure no face was found, and we correctly return face_detected: False.

## 2. Frontend Improvement: Smooth Out the "Face Lost" Signal
Your frontend has a good mechanism for handling distractions (consecutiveFailures). However, sometimes the model can fail for a single frame even if your face is present. Your logic already handles this well by waiting for 2 failures, which is great! We can just make the status badge update logic a little cleaner.

In your HTML file, the handleFocusData function is already quite robust. No major changes are needed there, as the backend fix will provide it with much more accurate data to work with. The existing MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES acts as a nice smoothing filter.

## 3. Visual Debugging: See What the Server Sees
It's incredibly helpful to see what your detection model is actually doing. You can modify the server to draw a rectangle around the detected face on the video feed it provides. This will give you instant feedback.

In eye_tracking_server.py, you can modify the _read_frames method to perform detection and draw on the frame. This is more efficient than the /api/get_enhanced_gaze endpoint doing it.

Update the _read_frames method in eye_tracking_server.py:

Python

# In EyeTrackingServer class in eye_tracking_server.py

def _read_frames(self):
    """Background thread to continuously read frames from camera."""
    while self.frame_thread_active and self.camera_active:
        if self.cap and self.cap.isOpened():
            ret, frame = self.cap.read()
            if ret:
                # Mirror the frame for natural viewing
                frame = cv2.flip(frame, 1)
                
                # --- START NEW DEBUG CODE ---
                # If tracking is active, process the frame for visual feedback
                if self.tracking_active:
                    # We need a copy to process because the tracker might modify it
                    debug_frame = frame.copy()
                    
                    # Convert to RGB for MediaPipe
                    rgb_frame = cv2.cvtColor(debug_frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
                    rgb_frame.flags.setflags(write=False)
                    
                    # Process with the tracker
                    results = self.eye_tracker.face_detection.process(rgb_frame)
                    
                    # Draw bounding box if face is detected
                    if results.detections:
                        for detection in results.detections:
                            bboxC = detection.location_data.relative_bounding_box
                            ih, iw, _ = debug_frame.shape
                            bbox = int(bboxC.xmin * iw), int(bboxC.ymin * ih), \
                                   int(bboxC.width * iw), int(bboxC.height * ih)
                            cv2.rectangle(frame, bbox, (0, 255, 0), 2) # Draw a green box
                    else:
                        # Optional: Indicate that no face is detected
                        cv2.putText(frame, "No Face Detected", (20, 40), 
                                    cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 0, 255), 2)
                # --- END NEW DEBUG CODE ---
                
                with self.frame_lock:
                    self.current_frame = frame
        
        time.sleep(0.01) # Small delay to prevent CPU overload
Now, if you view the /api/video_feed stream in your browser, you will see a green box around any detected face, giving you perfect visual feedback on the model's performance.

## 4. Check Your Environment
Finally, computer vision is very sensitive to the physical environment. Ensure you have:

Good Lighting: Your face should be well-lit from the front. Light coming from behind you (backlighting) is a major cause of detection failure.

Clear View: Make sure your hair isn't covering your eyes/face and that you are not too far from or too close to the camera.

Simple Background: A cluttered background, especially with pictures or posters of other faces, can confuse the model.

By implementing the backend confidence check and using the visual debugger, you should see a dramatic improvement in your application's accuracy.
